# How to compile and run Super Kou v0.6.0

Super Kou needs J2SE Development Kit 5 (1.5) or newer to build and run.
It also depends on the external library JInput for gamepad support.
JInput can be downloaded seperately from http://jinput.dev.java.net/.
The version used during development was jinput_combined_dist_20070726.zip,
but any newer version will probably work too.

Step by step guide:
1. Extract the contents of superkou-0.6.0-src.tar.gz somewhere.
2. Go into the folder you just created, and extract the contents of the JInput archive you downloaded there.
3. Compile with the command "javac -cp .:dist/jinput.jar net/usikkert/superkou/Main.java". Replace "dist" with whatever folder jinput.jar is located in.
4. Run Super Kou with the command "java -Djava.library.path=.:dist -cp .:dist/jinput.jar net.usikkert.superkou.Main".

If you are on Windows, you might need to replace ":" with ";", and "/" with "\" for the commands to work.
