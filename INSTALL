Super Kou needs J2SE Development Kit 5 (1.5) or newer.

The recommended way to build is by using Maven.
If you don't have Maven, download from http://maven.apache.org/

To compile, stay in the root folder where pom.xml is, and run:
'mvn clean package'

You need to tell Java where to find the native libraries if you are going to play using a gamepad.
Add the following vm parameter: -Djava.library.path=target/natives

Have fun! :)
